      <h1> Project Idea </h1>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Overview </em> </h4>
      <p>The project I would like to propose is an instant messaging application or social media service primarily focused on users of the Public Transport of Victoria. The application aims to connect commuters to each other in order to build community relationships or pass time in a more meaningful and connected manner. This will be done through a proximity-based group chat that users can freely enter, message in real time, play simple games such as air hockey and then leave after their trip on public transport is complete. All user interaction is to be done anonymously with personal names and details being omitted and are instead replaced by customisable monikers and characters.</p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Motovation </em> </h4>
      <p>It is estimated that Australians spend around 47 minutes on a standard public transport commute every day (Moovitapp 2021). That is almost two hours of the entire day spent sitting in a train carriage or bus, blankly staring out a window or scrolling and refreshing social media constantly. Furthermore, there is a level of social discomfort that has been emerging due to crowding and a steadily increasing population battling a slowly expanding transport infrastructure. Research suggests that when interactive strategies such as talking and positive body language is used, it can help lower levels of social discomfort, whereas a lack of social interaction boosts the formation of a negative relationship and perpetuates a socially stagnant atmosphere (The Social Environment of Public Transport 2009). The aim of this project would be to provide a more meaningful method of travel and encourage passengers to interact with one another to promote a more socially vibrant traveling atmosphere which would be beneficial to all passengers.   </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Description </em> </h4>
      <p>The product would be released in the form of a phone application hopefully endorsed by the public transport network of the state and allow users to open the app and connect to a chat room that is limited to the proximity of the bus or train carriage that they are in, forming a closed network that can only be accessed through location services or by scanning a unique QR code found in the vehicle or station. Users would only be able to use the app when waiting at a station or stop or when traveling in a vehicle that is in transit, once a user is nearing the edge of the proximity of a station, stop or vehicle, the application will warn them that they are about to leave the chat room. If a user enters or leaves or is forced to leave a chatroom, the app will send a small, unintrusive notification to the other users that a user has joined or left.<br> <br>
        Once in the chatroom, users can customise their names and avatars to premade selections and colours to allow for some individual freedom whilst also maintaining social protocols and guidelines (i.e no offensive names or images would be allowed to show). From there, users are free to chat to one another in a large main chat room where they can use various functions to communicate including basic instant texting, custom emoticons endorsed by PTV and various mini games that can be played in either groups or pairs.<br> <br>
        There will be restrictions on words that can be used when chatting, which will aim to censor profanities and illegal issues or substances, this will be implemented to protect underage users and to minimise criminal activity.  If users wish to private message another user, they will be able to send a message request, but it will be displayed in the whole group as a notification. This is to stimulate real life where if someone were to open a conversation to another person, the surrounding people would be aware of the fact. After which the other user can either decline or accept the message request which would once again send a notification into the group. There will be a few minigames included in the app on launch but there will also be community inclusion to allow for open sourced and user designed games to be played, rated and included into the app every quarter or so.
        Users that repeatedly use the application for nefarious reasons or to cause mischief and social discord will be monitored and potentially suspended or banned from the app if deemed necessary. If a case such as this does occur, users are allowed to submit a ticket to support where a highly trained team will objectively review the ticket and pass a vote on whether an individual would be allowed to regain access to their account and continue using the app.

      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Tools and Technologies </em> </h4>
      <p>Users would require access to a mobile device capable of location services and a stable connection to internet on their devices. Servers would be needed to remotely store chatrooms, community created games and user metrics to help gather statistics and data for further development and improvement. A team of programmers would require workstations and specific coding software in order to develop the application and they would also require mobile phones to test and prototype on. Finally, a support team would need their own workstations and systems in order to deal with customer complaints and inquiries.  </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Skills Required </em> </h4>
      <p>In order to create this application and successfully run it, a number of skills would be required. Firstly, project management and client facing communication would be vital to ensure that the application produces a result that meets both the needs of the client that endorsed it (PTV) and the needs of the users (public transport rider). After a strong relationship is built with the client and goals are set, the building of the application itself would come next requiring experienced coders and programmers to develop the application itself. User-experience designers would also be appreciated in order to produce a product that is aesthetically pleasing and ensures the product performs as smoothly as possible.   </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Outcome </em> </h4>
      <p>Should the application be successful in its implementation, the results should show a more interconnected social atmosphere when traveling on public transport. Giving users the ability to anonymously message one another, allowing for a level of confidence not present when having to directly confront someone face to face, this should theoretically encourage more social interaction to take place and reduce social stagnation and discomfort. People that travel on social media may also feel that their time traveling is less wasted and more meaningful by making small yet impactful connections and sharing their time with the strangers around them. </p>
