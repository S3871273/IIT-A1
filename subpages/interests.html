      <h1> My Interest in Information Technology </h1>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> What is your interest in IT? </em> </h4>
      <p> My interest in Information Technology currently lies in the general field of hardware and hardware applications of personal computers (PCs) although,  recently I have become more interested in the commercial aspect of information systems and how, if at all, businesses employ and make use of their own systems. On a personal and consumer level, I have a great passion in finding ways to personalise and optimise PCs for their end users and ensuring that every dollar spent on the system offers some form of value to the individual. On a more commercial and professional side, my personal interest in PCs has led me to be curious of how different businesses, both large and small, employ and set up their systems and servers, what hardware they use, how these systems are configured and if they can be improved upon. I also enjoy the application of IT and robots or artificial intelligence to streamline and help perform mundane tasks that would otherwise be left to a human to do for hours and hours a day. I believe that humans have a great deal of potential and individuality to offer, but our time is often wasted or allocated elsewhere as simply manpower in a production line.
      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> My experience in IT </em> </h4>
      <p> The growth of the technology over the last two decades has led to an overwhelming number of choices to consider when purchasing any form of computer system. In my spare time I enjoy sifting through data and benchmarks of various hardware products to help me make a more informed decision when I am making my own purchases or recommendations for friends and family. I also have over four years of experience in building and maintaining PCs as a hobby and have configured, built and set up multiple windows machines for different users such as gamers, graphic designers and people who were forced to work-from-home.
      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> When did your interest in IT start? </em> </h4>
      <p>From a very early age, I believe I had learnt how to type before I had learnt how to properly write my first words. This was all thanks to my uncle who was, and still is, a very enthusiastic technophile who would always show off their latest game or hardware to me and my older brother. My interest in IT started through simply using systems to play games with my older bother but over time the second-hand computers that were gifted to us could no longer play the latest games and the computers themselves would slow down dramatically. This obstacle motivated me to learn about how these systems work, how they can be improved and how each component has a cause and effect on the overall system’s performance. </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Why did you chose to come to RMIT? </em> </h4>
      <p> I chose to study at RMIT as my uncle who introduced me to technology was an alumni from RMIT and had spoken highly about the course as well as the university itself when he was a student. Furthermore, the “work integrated learning” at RMIT and its focus on current industry trends and knowledge appealed to me as I did not see other universities place as much as a focus on life after university as RMIT has. Another aspect which led me to decide on RMIT was the recognition and renown that RMIT has been able to accomplish giving its graduates global recognition across the world. This means if I ever plan to travel and take my career outside of Australia, I can be confident that the qualifications that I had gained from RMIT would still be recognised and approved of no matter where I choose to call home.   </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </em> </h4>
      <p> Over the course of my studies, I expect to be equipped with the skills to gain entry level access into the field or profession of my choosing as well as the ability to read trends in the information technology world and where it is headed. The skills I would like to learn would include but are not limited to, programming in various languages, such as Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The ability to administer, set up and diagnose systems, networks and servers on various levels and scale. The knowledge and skills to become a professional consultant and manage or work alongside a team for a project or client(s). I would also like to learn a little bit about security and cloud computing as I feel it would complement my current interests in systems administration and analysis. </p>
