			<h1> Nationality, Educational Background and Interest </h1>
			<p> I am an Australian born, Vietnamese male that can speak English fluently as my native language and can utilise Vietnamese at a beginner level in reading, writing and conversing.<br><br>
				My educational background includes the completion of high school, having graduated from Nossal High School in 2017 and I have transferred to the Bachelor of Information Technology after doing 2 semesters in a Bachelor of International Business at Monash and 1 semester of a Bachelor of Professional Communication at RMIT. Both of these degrees are incomplete, as I had chosen to transfer out of them due to my interests and end goals misaligning with the skills provided in these degrees over time. <br><br>
				In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime, playing games and cooking. I also enjoy researching and working with PC hardware, building and maintaining my own system as well as helping friends out with their own computer issues.
