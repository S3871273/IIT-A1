      <h1> IT Consultant </h1>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Job Description and Appeal </em> </h4>
      <p>My current ideal job is as an IT consultant representing a small IT services company that was recently founded in 2019. The role involves working with a range of different clients in various fields such as construction, healthcare and entertainment to deliver exceptional and innovative IT solutions whilst supporting and overseeing the implementation of the technology. This job primarily appeals to me as I would be working in a small business, directly with the director of the company as well as one other IT consultant which would minimise bureaucracy and allow matters to be handled efficiently, directly from clients to company. Another standout factor is the amount of flexibility given in this role, given its broad reach into many different industries, this means that no two clients will ever be the same allowing for each day at work to be different from the last and offer new challenges to keep things interesting. Finally, this role deals face to face with customers and clients and has a large degree of customer service which I find very fulfilling and satisfying. Offering real life solutions to people’s problems and using my expertise to genuinely make a difference in people’s lives would make me extremely happy and maintain job satisfaction.
      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Skills and Qualifications Required </em> </h4>
      <p> From the job description posted, a lot of skills and knowledge are required in order to be a successful applicant for the role. Firstly, they require an accredited degree in either Information Technology or another related field. And secondly, the hard skills that a potential candidate should have are numerous and include knowledge of Microsoft (Sever 2003-2009, Exchange, SQL, Windows 7-10, Virtualisation Hyper-V, Remote Desktop Services), Networking experience (Routers, Firewalls, LTE), Microsoft Administration, Hardware and storage as well as cloud technology. Soft skills that are mentioned include, overseeing and supporting client operations, exemplar communication skills, problem solving and customer service. Prior experience as an IT consultant is also highly regarded.
      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Current Skills and Qualifications </em> </h4>
      <p>Currently, if I were to apply to this position, I would be lacking many of the professional hard skills required but believe I have some transferable soft skills. Regarding the technical knowledge, I have no knowledge of managing Microsoft systems, networks, servers, routers or cloud technology. My hard skills so far can only translate to roughly 4 years’ worth of troubleshooting and repairing single PC systems and some very simple hardware and storage solutions as a hobby. However, my soft skills from working in customer service from the last 3 years would be highly transferable in this role as I have honed my communication and client facing skills. I believe I would be very adept in conversing and supporting clients in order to ensure their needs are met and that they have received a service of quality and value.
      </p>
      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> How do you plan to obtain the skills and qualifications required? </em> </h4>
      <p> In order to one day meet the criteria for this position, I plan to learn most, if not all, of the required hard skills listed, either through my current studies in a Bachelor of Information Technology or continued studies into a master’s degree. After acquiring all the relevant knowledge, I would then move onto finding an entry level position as either an intern or a graduate position in systems administration or analysis. I believe a starting role in these fields would allow me to learn how systems and information technology operate and are organised in real world enterprises and grant me entry level experience in preparation for a higher role in my first major project. Granted my first major project is a success and I received high commendations and feedback from my superiors and client. I would then aim to work in various other projects to build up my portfolio until I feel confident enough to apply for a consultancy position. All the while, I would also like to maintain a consistent level of learning and would try to keep up to date with the latest technological advances so as to not fall behind and have more tools to utilise for future projects.
