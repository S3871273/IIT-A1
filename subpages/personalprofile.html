      <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Learning Style and mgram.me Test Results </em> </h4>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343288939609849866/826060079149219850/testresults.jpg" alt="results">

        <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </em> </h4>
        <p> The results from the tests conducted show me three different things, firstly the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test represents my introverted nature in combination with my core values of empathy and genuineness, secondly the VARK test demonstrates how effectively I am capable of learning through kinesthetic means and lastly the mgram test shows a more rounded display of my personality from the MBTI results. The most standout results from the MBTI test are the mind and tactics results which lean heavily towards introversion and prospecting. This represents my preference and comfort in working independently as well as my dislike for rigid plans and deadlines whenever I am working on a project or assignment. When looking at the VARK test results for learning styles it is noted that I am most attuned to primarily kinesthetic learning followed by visual learning. This is true as I find I learn best when first, being allowed to observe and watch a demonstration, followed by hands-on practical practice. Finally, the last test conducted from mgram.me note my top 8 key personality traits that I believe have formed from my INFP personality type and offer a little bit more insight into who I am as a person. We can see how many of the traits such as “Align With Others” and “Considerate” match with my “feeling” nature and how my “No Rush” trait aligns with my “prospecting” tactics.
        </p>
        <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </em> </h4>
        <p> Given the opportunity to work in a team, I believe the test results would lead me to work in a position away from being a leader and take on more of a supportive or background role. My strong affinity to introversion as well as being “reserved” and “pliant” would not be very conducive if given the role to lead a team as I would not be able to drive a strong sense of direction or be able to speak firmly to team members who have differing opinions and thoughts. Furthermore, being a “prospecting” type and planning averse, the need and upkeep for schedules and deadlines would be difficult to maintain as a team leader, which could lead to projects either not being finished on time or de-railing into other directions. My strengths then, lie in playing a supporting role in a team as I am able to perform my duties in a more independent manner and do not have to concern myself with strife within the group, which the leader would be more skilled in dealing with. Furthermore, my prospecting nature can be allowed to act freely, allowing for more innovative and creative ideas to be brought forward whilst also being properly judged by a leader with clear motives and direction so that the team is able to meet their goals.  </p>
        <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </em> </h4>
        <p> It can be agreed from the results of the test that, when forming a team, it would be best to consider allowing others to take upon the position of team leader or project leader and instead take on a more support orientated role. This would allow my strengths to shine through by giving me autonomy and independence to focus and work on my own tasks as well as allowing for my innovation and creativity to be directed towards the project and not get lost in tangents and side-projects. Furthermore, having a leader would be beneficial as there would be someone who can keep me on track and ensure that my prospecting nature does not leave me rushing to meet deadlines.
          It must be noted though, that whilst these tests and their results can allow insights to how I best perform in a team, they are still at best simple metrics done online and must be approached with caution. There have often been times, simply due to the nature of the situation, where I have been a team leader and whilst my own and the team’s performance was not exemplar, we still managed to complete our tasks to a high standard with efficiency.
